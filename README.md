# My Recipes App

What I did:
Created a recipe app with functionalities for inserting, fetching, and removing recipes or ingredients.

How I did it:
Utilized the sqflite plugin to implement SQLite-based databases for persistent data storage. Incorporated streams to receive real-time updates.

Results:
Developed a cross-platform app (Android and iOS) that effectively manages recipes and ingredients, utilizing SQLite databases for data persistence. The use of streams enables seamless updates and synchronization with the database.
